We've all heard of the phrase "location, location, location". When analyzing past
HDB resale prices, it is a no-brainer to expect high prices at valuable locations.
For most of us HDB-dwellers, proximity to MRT stations are almost surely one of, if not the most
important location decision.

However, the data is not as simple as it seems. Take any HDB town, and pull out the highest
and lowest transactions. You may get a picture like this from the 3 room flats in Woodlands the past year:

Rather than location, the main common features in the cheapest and most expensive flats is the year the flat
is built. We found this in the previous analysis of the transactions using decision trees and random forests,
and the feature importance of the year the flat is built is still by far the strongest even after adding location data.

So my hypothesis was: if AI and machine learning is worth the hype it should be able to untangle the mess of all the underlying
data and locate the major MRT stations in each town just from the pasts resale transaction alone.

## Failed attempt

My first few attempts unfortunately didn't do too well. I made some tweaks, went through a few false dawns, and then
back to square one again.
One result is the following, suggesting that Marsiling is the hottest region in Woodlands!

## Success at last

It turns out that a bigger data set (expanding the analysis from just on 3 room flats to flats of all sizes)
did the job, and, along with the techniques I learned along the way, I got the following results:

Testing the exact same methodology on different towns mostly gave very similar results. So I'm excited to
do all the grunt work to get those done and share the full results soon.

I used the following prompts, and got something I like at the
3rd
attempt!

2. Robot operating a drill at a construction site
3. Cute robot wearing a hard hat in front of a construction site
