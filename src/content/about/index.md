Hi there! I'm Kelvin from ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singapore!

My background is in mathematics, having transitioned from an engineering
degree to a M.Sc in math, and then teaching/tutoring primarily at high school level for over 15 years.

I started exploring tech/web development in the last couple of years, broadly fuelled by the Covid lockdowns.
A couple of years in, my interest/motivation in the field is still going strong, with many hobby projects
still receiving ongoing developmental attention. I particularly enjoy working with Svelte(+kit).

Inspired by [swyx's You Are Not Too Old (To Pivot Into AI)](https://www.latent.space/p/not-old), I am giving
AI a try.

My past forays into the field were fleeting. I dabbled in data science via
football analytics Ã  la [StatsBomb](https://statsbomb.com/) and
[FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/premier-league/), and machine
learning through [Andrew Ng's coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

In this second go-around I'm going through the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/) and initial impressions are very positive!
This website/blog will document my journey through the course and beyond.

### Some of my projects

#### Math-adjacent

- [Math Repo](https://math-repo.vercel.app/) A repository of past exam solutions, crafted to display well on digital devices
- [Math Pro](https://math-pro.vercel.app/) (WIP) Programmatic + random variations of past exam questions, with support for auto-grading of answers
- [Mathlify](https://github.com/kelvinsjk/mathlify/tree/main/packages/mathlify) A computer algebra system (CAS) library built in JavaScript that powering the two projects above
- [Mathlifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathlifier) A KaTeX wrapper library that makes it easier to write reactive and dynamic mathematical content. Surprisingly used by
  [other people](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/1078jsx/using_latex_math_in_sveltekit_mdsvex/), despite minimal promotion outside of publishing to npm
- [3D Vectors](https://3d-vectors.vercel.app/) (May not work on apple devices at the moment) An applet to do point/line/plane 3D vector calculations

#### Others

-[Spinner Dinner](https://spinner-dinner.netlify.app/) Can't decide what to eat for dinner? Spin the wheel and let it decide!
